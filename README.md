# PDF Highlight Extractor
As a post-grad student, I have to read a lot of PDF documents and I tend to do a lot of highlighting while reading and them process these highlights with a speciallized software (Docear).
However, in order to use these highlights effectively, I needed a tool to extract the text from these highlights and embed the text as the highlight comment. PDF Hihglight Extractor is a very simple tool that does this.
I publish it because I know that there are a lot of poor soul out there facing the same problem. I hope this helps.
